Welcome to the Data Analytics Projects Repository! This repository houses a collection of data science and analytics projects that I have worked on. Each project is designed to explore, analyze, and derive insights from various datasets. Feel free to explore the projects, and I encourage you to provide feedback or contribute.

## Projects

### [Police data analysis](link_to_project_1)
- The primary objective of the data analytics project focused on a police dataset is to derive significant insights that can drive enhancements in police management, safety protocols, and enforcement strategies.    
- I am exploring several key questions within this research:
Numerical Evidence of Racial and Gender Bias: One of our primary areas of focus is the examination of numerical evidence pertaining to racial and gender bias. We aim to delve into data and statistics to discern whether there are disparities or inequities in law enforcement interactions, arrests, or outcomes based on factors such as race and gender. Our objective is to uncover and analyze patterns, if any.     
- Environmental Factors Impacting Police Behavior: In this aspect, we explore the multifaceted relationship between environmental conditions, such as weather, and the conduct of police officers. We endeavor to understand how external factors like extreme heat, cold, rain, or snow can influence law enforcement responses and decision-making. By dissecting the impact of environmental variables on police actions, we seek to enhance our comprehension of the dynamic interplay between weather conditions and law enforcement behavior, ultimately contributing to more nuanced and context-aware policing strategies.

### [AB test of website](link_to_project_2)
- Objective: The objective of an A/B test project for a web page is to compare two or more versions of a web page to see which one performs better.
- This can be done by measuring metric as conversion rate.    
By running an A/B test, you can gather data to make informed decisions about which version of the web page to use on your live site. 

- Key technologies and tools used.
- Any specific insights or outcomes.
