# **In my GitHub repository**, I will be uploading files related to a data analytics project. The primary objective of this project is to thoroughly understand the data and construct a solid foundation for hypothesis testing.

Hypothesis testing is a critical phase in the data analytics process. It involves formulating educated assumptions or hypotheses about the data and then using statistical methods to test whether these hypotheses hold true or can be rejected based on the available evidence.
